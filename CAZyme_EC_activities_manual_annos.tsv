EC 4.2.2.9	galacturonan, pectate	lyase galacturonate alpha-(1,4) galacturonate	(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n = (1,4-alpha-D-galacturonosyl)n-2 + 4-(4-deoxy-alpha-D-galact-4-enuronosyl)-D-galacturonate [RN:R02361 R06240]. The enzyme catalyses the eliminative cleavage of an unsaturated disaccharide from the reducing end of homogalacturonan (the backbone of smooth regions of pectate, also known as de-esterified pectin).
EC 4.2.2.8	heparin sulfate	lyase N-acetylglucosamine AB glucuronate; lyase glucuronate AB N-acetylglucosamine	Elimination of sulfate; appears to act on linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and uronate. Product is an unsaturated sugar. Does not act on N,O-desulfated glucosamine or N-acetyl-O-sulfated glucosamine linkages.
EC 4.2.2.7	heparin sulfate	lyase X beta-(1,4) glucuronate; lyase X alpha-(1,4) glucose	Eliminative cleavage of polysaccharides containing (1->4)-linked D-glucuronate or L-iduronate residues and (1->4)-alpha-linked 2-sulfoamino-2-deoxy-6-sulfo-D-glucose residues to give oligosaccharides with terminal 4-deoxy-alpha-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends
EC 4.2.2.6	oligogalacturonan	lyase galacturonate alpha galacturonate; lyase X alpha galacturonate	4-(4-deoxy-alpha-D-galact-4-enuronosyl)-D-galacturonate = 2 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucuronate [RN:R04382 R06249]. Also catalyses eliminative removal of unsaturated terminal residues from oligosaccharides of D-galacturonate.
EC 4.2.2.5	chondroitin sulfate	lyase X beta-(1,3) N-acetylglucosamine; lyase X beta-(1,4) glucuronate	Acts on chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate, but less well on hyaluronate. In general, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) chains comprise a linkage region, a chain cap and a repeat region. The repeat region of CS is a repeating disaccharide of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) [-4)GlcA(beta1-3)GalNAc(beta1-]n, which may be O-sulfated on the C-4 and/or C-6 of GalNAc and C-2 of GlcA. GlcA residues of CS may be epimerized to iduronic acid (IdoA) forming the repeating disaccharide [-4)IdoA(alpha1-3)GalNAc(beta1-]n of DS. Both the concentrations and locations of sulfate-ester substituents vary with glucosaminoglycan source [4]. Eliminative degradation of polysaccharides containing 1,4-beta-D-hexosaminyl and 1,3-beta-D-glucuronosyl linkages to disaccharides containing 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl groups
EC 4.2.2.3	algin	lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) guluronate; lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) mannuronate	The enzyme catalyses the degradation of algin by a beta-elimination reaction. It cleaves the (1->4) bond between beta-D-mannuronate and either alpha-L-guluronate or beta-D-mannuronate, generating oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hex-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends and beta-D-mannuronate at the reducing end. Depending on the composition of the substrate, the enzyme produces oligosaccharides ranging from two to four residues, with preference for shorter products. cf. EC 4.2.2.11, guluronate-specific algin lyase.
EC 4.2.2.26	oligoalgin	lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) guluronate; lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) mannuronate	The enzyme degrades unsaturated oligosaccharides produced by the action of algin lyases (EC 4.2.2.3 and EC 4.2.2.11) on algin, by repeatedly removing the unsaturated residue from the non-reducing end until only unsaturated monosaccharides are left. The enzyme catalyses a beta-elimination reaction, generating a new unsaturated non-reducing end after removal of the pre-existing one. Cleavage of poly(4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hexopyranuronoside) oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends into 4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hex-4-enopyranuronate monosaccharides.

The tetrasaccharide produced from deacetylated gellan is beta-D-4-deoxy-Delta4-GlcAp-(1->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1->4)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1->3)-beta-D-Glcp.
EC 4.2.2.24	oligorhamnogalacturonan	lyase rhamnose alpha-(1,4) galacturonate	Exotype eliminative cleavage of alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyluronic acid bonds of rhamnogalacturonan I oligosaccharides containing alpha-L-rhamnopyranose at the reducing end and 4-deoxy-4,5-unsaturated D-galactopyranosyluronic acid at the non-reducing end. The products are the disaccharide 2-O-(4-deoxy-beta-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranuronosyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose and the shortened rhamnogalacturonan oligosaccharide containing one 4-deoxy-4,5-unsaturated D-galactopyranosyluronic acid at the non-reducing end.
EC 4.2.2.23	rhamnogalacturonan	lyase rhamnose alpha-(1,4) galacturonate	Endotype eliminative cleavage of L-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1->4)-alpha-D-galactopyranosyluronic acid bonds of rhamnogalacturonan I domains in ramified hairy regions of pectin leaving L-rhamnopyranose at the reducing end and 4-deoxy-4,5-unsaturated D-galactopyranosyluronic acid at the non-reducing end.
EC 4.2.2.20	chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate	endo N-acetylgalactosamine beta-(1,4) glucuronate; endo N-acetylglucosamine beta-(1,4) iduronate	Endolytic cleavage of (1->4)-beta-galactosaminic bonds between N-acetylgalactosamine and either D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic acid to produce a mixture of Delta4-unsaturated oligosaccharides of different sizes that are ultimately degraded to Delta4-unsaturated tetra- and disaccharides
EC 4.2.2.2	alpha-(1,4)-galacturonan, pectate	eilm galacturonate alpha-(1,4) galacturonate	Eliminative cleavage of (1->4)-alpha-D-galacturonan to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-D-galact-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends [RN:R08694]. Favours pectate, the anion, over pectin, the methyl ester (which is the preferred substrate of EC 4.2.2.10, pectin lyase).
EC 4.2.2.19	dermatan sulfate	lyase glucuronate beta-(1,3) N-acetylgalactosamine; lyase iduronate beta-(1,3) N-acetylgalactosamine	Eliminative cleavage of dermatan sulfate containing (1->4)-beta-D-hexosaminyl and (1->3)-beta-D-glucurosonyl or (1->3)-alpha-L-iduronosyl linkages to disaccharides containing 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl groups to yield a 4,5-unsaturated dermatan-sulfate disaccharide (DeltaUA-GalNAc-4S).
EC 4.2.2.18	beta-(2,1)-fructan, inulin	lyase fructose beta-(2,1) fructose	Produces alpha-D-fructofuranose beta-D-fructofuranose 1,2':2,3'-dianhydride (DFA III) by successively eliminating the diminishing (2->1)-beta-D-fructan (inulin) chain from the terminal D-fructosyl-D-fructosyl disaccharide.
EC 4.2.2.17	beta-(2,1)-fructan, inulin	lyase fructose beta-(2,1) fructose	This enzyme, like EC 4.2.2.16 [levan fructotransferase (DFA-IV-forming)] and EC 4.2.2.18 [inulin fructotransferase (DFA-III-forming)] eliminates the fructan chain from the terminal disaccharide leaving a difructose dianhydride. These enzymes have long been known as fructotransferases, so this is retained in the accepted name. Since the transfer is intramolecular, the reaction is an elimination and, hence, the enzyme is a lyase, belonging in EC 4.
EC 4.2.2.15	N-acetylneuraminide	lyase X alpha sialate	Elimination of alpha-sialyl groups in N-acetylneuraminic acid glycosides, releasing 2,7-anhydro-alpha-N-acetylneuraminate
EC 4.2.2.14	beta-(1,4)-glucuronan	lyase glucuronate beta-(1,4) glucuronate	Eliminative cleavage of (1->4)-beta-D-glucuronans to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. Complete degradation of glucuronans results in the formation of tetrasaccharides.
EC 4.2.2.13	alpha-(1,4)-glucan, maltose, starch	lyase glucose alpha-(1,4) glucose	The enzyme catalyses the sequential degradation of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucans from the non-reducing end with the release of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose. Thus, for an alpha-glucan containing n (1->4)-linked glucose units, the final products are 1 glucose plus (n-1) 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose. Maltose, maltosaccharides and amylose are all completely degraded. It does not degrade (1->6)-alpha-glucosidic bonds and thus the degradation of a branched glucan, such as amylopectin or glycogen, will result in the formation of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose plus a limit dextrin. Other enzymes involved in the anhydrofructose pathway are EC 4.2.1.110 (aldos-2-ulose dehydratase), EC 4.2.1.111 (1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase) and EC 5.3.2.7 (ascopyrone tautomerase).

EC 4.2.2.11	algin	lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) guluronate; lyase guluronate beta-(1,4) guluronate; lyase mannuronate beta-(1,4) mannuronate; lyase guluronate beta-(1,4) mannuronate	Eliminative cleavage of algin to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-alpha-L-erythro-hex-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends and alpha-L-guluronate at their reducing end.
EC 4.2.2.10	pectin, alpha-(1,4)-galacturonan	lyase galacturonate alpha-(1,4) galacturonate	Eliminative cleavage of (1->4)-alpha-D-galacturonan methyl ester to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-6-O-methyl-alpha-D-galact-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. Favours pectin, the methyl ester, over pectate, the anion (which is the preferred substrate of EC 4.2.2.2, pectate lyase). Demethylation progressively slows its action; it can nevertheless cleave on either side of a demethylated residue if the residue at the other end of the scissile bond is methylated.
EC 4.2.2.1	hyaluronate	lyase N-acetylglucosamine beta-(1,4) glucosamine	Cleaves hyaluronate chains at a beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcA bond, ultimately breaking the polysaccharide down to 3-(4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. [RN:R02465 R06242]

EngBF from the bacterium Bifidobacterium longum specifically acts on core 1-type O-glycan to release the disaccharide Gal-(1->3)-beta-GalNAc. The enzymes from the bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Alcaligenes faecalis show broader specificity (e.g. they can also release the core 2 trisaccharide Gal-(1->3)-beta-(GlcNAc-(1->6)-beta)-GalNAc or the core 3 disaccharide GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-GalNAc) [1,2]. The enzyme may play an important role in the degradation and utilization of mucins having core 1 O-glycan.

The enzyme cleaves the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans from proteoglycan core proteins and degrades them to small oligosaccharides. Inside cells, the enzyme is important for the normal catabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, generating glycosaminoglycan fragments that are then transported to lysosomes and completely degraded. When secreted, heparanase degrades basement membrane heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans at sites of injury or inflammation, allowing extravasion of immune cells into nonvascular spaces and releasing factors that regulate cell proliferation and angiogenesis [1].

The enzyme can also hydrolyse alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase-treated arabinogalactan protein (AGP) extracted from radish roots [2,3].

The enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of the four (1->2)-linked alpha-D-mannose residues from the Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide attached to target proteins as described in reaction (1). Alternatively, the enzymes act on the Man8GlcNAc2 isomer formed by EC 3.2.1.209, endoplasmic reticulum Man9GlcNAc2 1,2-alpha-mannosidase, as described in reaction (2). The enzymes are type II membrane proteins, require Ca2+, and use an inverting mechanism. While all three human enzymes can catalyse the reactions listed here, some of the enzymes can additionally catalyse hydrolysis in an alternative order, generating additional isomeric intermediates, although the final product is the same. The names of the isomers listed here are based on a nomenclature system proposed by Prien et al [7]
